# Vault Keeper ☢️
## Python Password Vault

- Vault Keeper is a beginner-friendly Python learning project that walks through building a simple encrypted password manager (vault) from scratch. 

- The goal is to understand how encrypted password storage works.

- This is **not** a production-ready password manager.

---

## Goals

  1. Learn how passwords can be encrypted at rest.
    
  2. Understand encryption vs hashing.
    
  3. Practice deriving keys from a master password.
    
  4. Safely store and retrieve secrets from disk.
    
  5. Think clearly about security assumptions and limits.

## What Does Vault Keeper Do❓

  - Derives an encryption key from a master password.

  - Encrypts password entries before saving them.

  - Stores secrets in a local encrypted vault file.

  - Decrypts data only after successful authentication.

  - Demonstrates common secure-storage patterns.

## Vault Keeper is NOT:

❌ A production password manager.

❌ A replacement for audited security tools.

❌ Safe for real credentials.

---

## How It Works 🔎

At a high level:

  1. User sets a master password
     
  2. A cryptographic key is derived from that password
     
  3. Password entries are encrypted
     
  4. Encrypted data is written to disk
     
  5. Data is decrypted only with the correct master password

---

## Educational Threat Model 

Vault Keeper assumes a local attacker who may gain access to the vault file but does *not* know the master password.

**Defends against:**

  - Plaintext password storage

  - Accidental exposure of secrets

  - Basic offline inspection
    

**Does not defend against:**

  - Malware or keyloggers

  - Weak master passwords

  - OS compromise

  - Advanced cryptographic attacks

## Tools 🧰

- Python standard library

- hashlib

- secrets

- os

- json

*(Crypto choices will be documented as the project evolves.)*

## How to Run ⏯️

1. Clone the repository

2. Ensure Python 3.9+ is installed

3. Run:

`python vault-keeper.py`

---

## Example of Output

```bash
Welcome to VaultKeeper

Create a master password:
✔ Vault initialized.

Add entry:
Service: github
Username: v4u1t-k33p3r
Password: ********
✔ Entry encrypted and stored.

Unlock vault:
Enter master password:
✔ Vault unlocked.
```

## Security Notes 🔏

  - Master password strength matters

  - Encrypted ≠ invulnerable

  - Never hard-code secrets

  - Prefer audited tools for real-world use
